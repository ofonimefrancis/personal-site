I recently posted to the [gatsby reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatsbyjs/) with one of my articles. One of the comments I received was:

> How can I subscribe to new posts? If you donâ€™t have an RSS feed, maybe an article on it would be cool?

While I was happy that someone was showing interest in my content, it also concerned me that they hadn't found the form for my email newsletter. I must admit that signups had been a little disappointing up to this moment. The UX designer in me thought we could do better! Lets implement a sign-up modal that isn't invasive! 

### How do you draw attention to sign up forms without being spammy?

We've all visited buzzfeed-type sites that bombard you with sign-up requests that feel invasive. I find that these often appear before I have even looked at the content that I came to see. It is my believe that this damages the user experience and would negatively impact my visitor count if I implemented it. Instead, I wanted to only encourage those that have shown interest in the content to sign up. I also think this leads to a higher quality audience that are more likely to interact with emails you send them.

So, how do we define an engaged user? I decided to opt for article views. **If a user has viewed 3 articles within 24 hours I think it is safe to assume they are interested in what I write about.** 

In order to know which articles you've viewed, I'm going to have to track them but I'd rather not take ownership of any data from users that I don't need so I will keep this information client-side by using `localstorage`. I have set up a [localstorage hook](https://github.com/slarsendisney/personal-site/blob/master/src/utils/customHooks.js) in my project that came in handy when [adding reactions to the site](/articles/Creating-Page-Reactions) and again now. When navigating to an article, I update my "views" localstorage to contain the time at which you looked at the current article (identified by contentID):

```jsx
setViewed({ ...viewed, [contentID]: new Date().getTime() })
```

Now my code can determine how many articles you have viewed in the last 24 hours with a little help from [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/):

```jsx
import { differenceInHours } from "date-fns"

function viewedArticlesToday(viewed) {
  const currentDate = new Date()
  let count = 0
  Object.keys(viewed).forEach((key) => {
    const articleViewedOn = new Date(viewed[key])
    if (differenceInHours(articleViewedOn, currentDate) <= 24) {
      count++
    }
  })
  return count
}
```

This alone is not enough as repeat visitors who navigate to an article would be prompted to subscribe all the time. That would certainly put them off visiting again! So I also decided to also use `localstorage` to remember when you last saw the modal and whether you had subscribed already. If you have already subscribed, or seen the modal in the last 3 days then it will leave you alone:

```jsx
import React, { useEffect } from "react"
import { differenceInDays } from "date-fns"

useEffect(() => {
    if (
      viewedArticlesToday(viewed) > 2 &&
      !subscribed &&
      differenceInDays(new Date(), new Date(lastSeenDate)) > 2
    ) {
      setModalVisible(true)
    }
  }, [])
```
